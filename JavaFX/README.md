## JavaFX 8: AddressApp

I followed the tutorial from [code.makery.ch](http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial) 
to learn about JavaFX 8.

## Setting up

- [Java JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Installation note for Ubuntu: Exact the downloaded tar file to "/usr/local/java/", add JAVA\_HOME to "/etc/profile", update alternatives for java, javac, and javaws. JDK contains JRE, JVM, and JavaFX.
- Download Eclipse with e(fx)clipse plugin. Or download from [here](http://efxclipse.bestsolution.at/install.html#all-in-one).
- Download [Scene Builder](http://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) executable to add to Eclipse later. This is the pre-built version, Oracle provides the source code.
